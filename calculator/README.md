I have personaly selected this structure with a more square approach, having in mind the company's website overall style.

Colour theme has also been chosen to make the component blend with the theme already present in the company's site.

Remarks:
Having created the project with the now decrecated npx create-react-app has proven difficult to work with the latest version of TypeScript (5.0.2), a workaround is needed to be able to use certain packages and is not very convenient.
(downgrading ts version in package.json and running npm i, was necessary for this project).
